# Crowbar: Client

This is an experimental implementation to replace the current CLI scripts of
the crowbar barclamps. This tool is intended to be installable standalone,
that way everybody who got access to the Crowbar admin network should be able
to manage Crowbar from remote.

The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) is currently
maintained by [SUSE](http://www.suse.com/) as an [OpenStack](http://openstack.org)
installation framework but is prepared to be a much broader function tool. It
was originally developed by the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack).
